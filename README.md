# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
 
# Machine Learning Certificate Workspace

This repository contains my coursework and exercises as I completed a **Machine Learning learning path**. It follows structured modules:

- **Regression & Classification**
- **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
- **Unsupervised Learning**

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks, code walkthroughs, and examples showcasing key ML algorithms and experiments.

## Why This Matters

- Helps organize your learning
- Great showcase for interviewers or peers to review your ML progression
- Strong evidence of hands-on work and continuous learning

## Navigate the Topics
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `1-Regression-and-Classification` | Fundamentals of supervised learning with examples |
| `2-Advanced-Learning-Algorithms` | Complex methods like ensemble, neural nets |
| `3-Unsupervised-Leaning` | Clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc. |

*(Note: fix typos like “Leaning” to “Learning” for polish.)*
